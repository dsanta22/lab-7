                        The Doctorate of Science in <a
                            href="https://math.gatech.edu/graduate/phd-computational-sciences-and-engineering">Computational
                            Science and Engineering (CSE) Program</a> is an interdisciplinary
                        program offered by the College of Computing, the College of Engineering, and the College of
                        Sciences.
                        The
                        CSE program addresses the body of knowledge, skills, and practices associated with the study of
                        computer-based
                        models of natural phenomena and engineered systems. Students will be required to obtain a
                        breadth of
                        knowledge
                        across a set of core areas in the CSE discipline, depth of knowledge in a specific computational
                        specialization
                        (e.g., numerical computing), and knowledge to apply computational techniques in a domain of
                        application.
                        Students
                        will be expected to integrate principles from mathematics, computer science, and engineering to
                        be able
                        to create
                        significant computational artifacts (e.g., software).
